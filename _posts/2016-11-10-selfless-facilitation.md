title: "Selfless Facilitation"

Meetings shouldn't suck.

But they often do.

There's a few reasons for sucky meetings: No agenda, no one knows why they are there, wrong people in the room.

But the easiest way to guarantee a meeting suck will suck is by poor facilitation.

At its best facilitation makes for an easy and productive meeting, with deep discussion of the ideas present and with the participants all being heard rather than a just a few loud voices.

But achieving this is hard.
And I'd argue is near impossible if the facilitator is also emotionally invested in the outcome of the meeting.

So I'd like to suggest that when we are facilitators that we become "Selfless Facilitators".

## Why selfless?

Facilitation is a a form of leadership. It's also a form of power.

During meetings the facilitator is the leader.
If the leader starts disagreeing with participants then they are subverting the authority of the group.
Once this happens the meeting is doomed.
Because there is no leader anymore.

What I recommend is that when we facilitate we focus of being the best facilitator we can be.
We avoid the temptation of getting involved in the core of the discussion at all.

So what does the facilitator do instead?

Instead the selfless facilitator is focusing on guiding and making sure their is a balance to who is speaking while reacting to the behaviour of the group.

## Getting everyone to speak and feel heard

Getting everyone to contribute is important.

It's how we create deep rather than shallow agreement.
It generates the most ideas and options.
Making sure we can pick our next action given the diverse experience in the room.

However, getting everyone to contribute can be hard.

A great trick is getting everyone to speak right at the start.
Each person introduces themself and answers a short question.
The question could be "what do you hope to learn here?" or something trivial like "What's your favourite food?".
If someone has spoken already, they are far more likely to speak later.

## Loud voices

Sometimes just getting everyone in the room can be difficult.
Another thing that that is difficult is making sure a handful of loud voices don't dominate the discussion.

One way around this is to ask everyone to help at the start.

During the opening remind everyone that we want to hear from all of those present, so we can learn and make the most informed decisions.
To help with this, ask that they become aware that if they have already spoken, then they should leave a brief pause before speaking again.

It's this brief pause that allows other folk to share their opinion.

Sometimes you see one person repeating the same point over and over.
They are doing this because they don't think they are being heard by the group.
If you detect this it can be worthwhile as an organiser to look the person in the eye and repeat part of what they've said.

## Encouraging discussion

Great.
We've got everyone to introduce themselves and asked the louder participants to become self-aware.
So we're done?

Not a chance.

Depending on your group, it tends to take a while before a group is openly discussing.
As a facilitator we need to encourage folk to discuss their ideas a bit more and ask others to comment.

You want to have a combination of initial, probing and clarifying questions to allow participants ideas to shine.

Initial questions set the scene, and depend largely on your format and topic of discussion.
Probing questions ask for clarification and sometimes elaboration on a response.
If a participant brings up a topic you don't know much about, or don't think the group will know much about, then it's a good time to ask for elaboration.

There's two more options that a facilitator can use.

Revisit what's already been said earlier and bring it into later discussions.
This can help a theme be discovered.
And encourage other participants to add their reactions to another comment. "How do you feel about X?"

Finally, learn to love silences.
Don't get worried that no one is speaking and feel like you have to fill the void.
Just let it hang there.

## Control and observe the environment

It's important to set the meeting environment up for success.

Little things can distract participants. Make sure there's little background noise. If you can, make sure it's easy for people to get a drink. Thirsty folk don't talk.

Setting the furniture up right is important too. Make sure everyone can see each other. Having chairs in a circle helps with this. Removing the table in the middle can help if you think a group is going to be shy.

Once the environment is ready it's worth watching participants body language during the meeting.

Are people engaged?

You can notice by watching them. They'll either be watching what people are saying or looking around the room. If only a few folk are making eye contact then it's time to move the conversation forward. This is a good trick to use when an off-topic agenda item comes up. You can let it run for a little while if the group seem interested.

If someone has a perplexed look on their face it can be worth calling them out on it. Folk can react non-verbally to what's being said. So it's worth studying facial expressions.

Lastly, remember to take a break. No one likes sitting for too long.

* Ask loud voices to leave a pause before speaking
* Ask initial, probing and clarifying questions to keep the discussion going
* Reiterate what's been said earlier and ask for reactions
* Love silences
* Observe body language and react to it
