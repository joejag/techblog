A great practice I recommend is having a mini To-Do list for new members of your team. It'd have a topic and a person on the team to speak to about it. This allows the new joiner to hear from every member of their new team and learn about the major topics in a face to face way, rather than spending the first few days guessing which bits of Confluence are still relevant.

An example deck could be:

 * Understanding the business problem we solve
 * How our workflow works
 * How we deploy our software

 Another one is understanding the organisational structure, which is normally represented by a hierarchical chart. I'd like to suggest something a bit more focused on the relationships between teams, rather than the boxes they are often put in.

 With a nod towards Simon Brown's [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) I call this the 4S model for visualing organisation relationships. This model allows you to "zoom" into your organisation, looking through the layers before understanding where the new person fits in.

 The four layers are:

 * System
 * Silos
 * Silo
 * Siblings

 We start at the whole org level and zoom into the team alone. For each level we draw the main actors on a whiteboard inside a bubble and drill down into the most relevant bubble each time. During each stage you are taking and answering questions to help clarify the relationships at each stage.

 So let's dive in!

## System

<p class='header-image'><img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2019/4s/system.jpg"/></p>

We start from the outside.

* __Scope__: 
  * Your organisation from the outside

* __Elements__: 
  * One big bubble with your company name
  * Your common customer types and their needs
  * The current goals of your company
  * A marker to say where you are

* __Talking points__:
  * Which company goal relates to them, how they will help to achieve that goal
  * A short history of the company
  * The relationships with customers and the types of demand they put on the system
  * The biggest challenges that the company are facing

Once this is done we zoom inside the big bubble.

## Silos

<p class='header-image'><img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2019/4s/silos.jpg"/></p>

If you are wondering what a silo is, it's any other part of your company that you refer to by group name rather then peoples names. Like HR, the board etc. Though not other teams in your department at this stage.

* __Scope__: 
  * Main departments relevelant to your team (not every department)

* __Elements__:
  * Departments
  * Relationships between the departments
  * A marker to say where you are

* __Talking points__:
  * How each deptartments interact
  * Any dependencies between departments
  * Any fraught relationships between places
  * Brief history and goal of each department

Now they know the communication flow between departments, we move onto our own department.

## Silo/Department 

<p class='header-image'><img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2019/4s/silo.jpg"/></p>

* __Scope__: 
  * Fellow teams in your department

* __Elements__:
  * Every team as a bubble
  * Any management/supporting team within your department their names and roles
  * Relationships between the teams when drawing arrows
  * Links to internal customers (e.g. back office order processing team)
  * A marker to say where you are

* __Talking points__:
  * How well has the relationship has been going between the other teams in your dept
  * How the supporting/management structure operate, how often you will see them
  * Any existing dependancies for getting work done between teams

Then finally, we get onto the team the new person is joining.

## Siblings/Team

<p class='header-image'><img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2019/4s/siblings.jpg"/></p>

* __Scope__: 
  * Individuals and their roles in your team

* __Elements__:
  * Every person in your immediate team and their role

* __Talking points__:
  * How long each person has been there
  * Relationships between team members

And that should be you. Remember at all levels it's about the interesting conversation you can have talking about the relationships between parts of the organisation. Given the nature of explaining relationships, I  wouldn't recommend keeping the 4S diagram as a sharable asset, instead just recreate each time it is needed.

Hopefully you can try this technique out next time someone starts with your team. This technique helps give them the context they need to undertand the important groups in your company and how your team relates to them.
