title: Why you want to use ZSH as your shell
---

ZSH has seen wide adoption by developers looking to improve their interactive shell experience. I'm rather late to this party, but I'd like you to join too.

I started cultivating a [bash profile](https://github.com/joejag/dotfiles) ever since I first logged into a shell. I’ve collected tab completions, aliases and functions that help get repetitive tasks done quick. When Zsh started to become popular the blogs and comments all focused on features I aleady had configured in my bash profile. I remained unconvinced.

Then I read about [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). A project that assembles good defaults for Zsh which has significant traction online. Being a late adopter, I’m writing this in a way that would of convinced me to switch shells immediately.

## Background

If you are confident with Bssh and concerned about losing the knowledge you've built up. Then please don’t worry, 99% of what you do in Bash works the same way in Zsh. You can change shells without losing the knowledge you’ve built up.

This guide uses Zsh version 5.0.2 and oh-my-zsh updated to the date of this article. I have not changed anything from the base install.

When you see __&lt;TAB&gt;__ in the examples it means hit the tab key, please don't type it in as is.

## Tab completion on 'cd'

Let's start off with a task we use all the time. The humble change directory command.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/cd_before.jpg" />

In Bash when you press __&lt;TAB&gt;__ you get prompted with a list of files in the current directory.

In the context of the __cd__ command this isn't particularly useful, as you can only go into directories. Zsh knows this and only shows you the possible valid destinations.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/cd_after.jpg" />

Not only does it help you with matches, it also allows you to use your keyboard to navigate to the directory you want.

The combination of an intelligent TAB complete and using the keyboard to interact with options is at the heart of what makes Zsh a joy to use.

## shorthand 'ls'

You don't have to type whole directory names, just type the first few letters enough to make it unique and Zsh will work the rest out.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/ls_shorthand_before.jpg" />

Hey presto!

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/ls_shorthand_after.jpg" />


## Clever history

You may be familiar with using __&lt;CTRL&gt;+R__ for performing a recursive search to find a previous command you typed in. This is a great way to reuse commands in Bash and Zsh.

Zsh goes one better. You can type part of a command and press &lt;UP&gt;

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/history_before.jpg" />

It finds the last command we typed starting with 'ls'. We could continue pressing up to cycle if we wanted.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/history_after.jpg" />

## Shared command history

In Bash each shell has it's own history. Zshs shares the command history with all active shells. This means you don't have to remember where you typed that command.

## Expand environment variables

We have envivornment variables available in our shells. Sometimes we want to manipulate the value of these variables or just visually inspect them

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/path_expansion_before.jpg" />

In Zsh you can press &lt;TAB&gt; to expand the value out.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/path_expansion_after.jpg" />


## Killer tab completion

I usually kill commands after inspecting them using __ps__ or if I'm confident with __pkill__, Zsh give you another option.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/kill_before.jpg" />

Hit tab and it will give you a keyboard navigatble list of commands that start with the letters you typed after __kill__

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/kill_after.jpg" />

## What was that switch?

To figure out how a command works you often try executing it either without parameters, with --help or look at the man page. Zsh gives you another option.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/switch_before.jpg" />

Type the start of the switch then press &lt;TAB&gt;. 

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/switch_after.jpg" />

This lists the switch name with inline documentation. You have the option to use keyboard navigation too.

This isn't constrained to just the __ls__ command. It works on a baffingly large amount of commands like __netstat__, __git__ and __chmod__.

## Help with Git

Everyone has their favourite aliases for git commands. oh-my-zsh has a bunch out of the box too.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/git_aliases.jpg" />

It also improves your prompt when you enter a git controlled directory.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/git_prompt.jpg" />

You can see the branch name I'm on and that little lightning bolt is telling me I have uncommitted changes in my working tree.


## Your last command failed

You may have noticed the green arrow at the start of my prompt in the screenshots. This indicates that my last command completed succssfully.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/fail_prompt.jpg" />

If my command fails the prompt turns red until another command is succesful.

## Globbing

In Bash I'm often using the __find__ command along with __xargs__ to find things and perform tasks with them. Zsh covers the majority of these scenarios with built in globbing support.

Let's say we have this project checked out and we wanted to just find files that changed today.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_time_before.jpg" />

We can add a modifier to the __ls__ search pattern to fitler for just what we want

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_time_after.jpg" />

Another handy trick is to use __**__ which performs a recursive search. Where can I find an example of a Rakefile under this directory?

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_recursive.jpg" />

Let's use a modifier again to recursivly find files over 20mb.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_large_files.jpg" />

We aren't limited to just using __ls__. How many lines of Clojure code do I have in this project?

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_wc.jpg" />

Let's say we want to recursively delete most of the clojure files in this project

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_rm_before.jpg" />

Hmm. I'd rather tbe sure about this. So let's press tab to get all the files listed explicitly instead.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/glob_rm_after.jpg" />

## Did you mean this instead?

Every now and again we forget the case of file names, or type the middle part of a name rather than the beginning by mistake. Zsh knows we do this, and auto-corrects us.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/autocorrect_before.jpg" />

Zsh cares.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/autocorrect_after.jpg" />

## Useful aliases

As well as git alaises, oh-my-zsh has a bunch of useful everyday aliases.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/cd_aliases.jpg" />

I'm a big fan of using __...__ to help you move up two directories.

## Tabs named after the running process

Having the tab name changed to be the same as the running process is useful when you are hunting down where you are running that server.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/tab_names.jpg" />

## Edit that long command in Vim

You can manipulate long commands in Bash and Zsh by using shortcuts like __&lt;CTRL&gt;+K__ to delete characters. But, yet sometimes you want the power of a more powerful editor for manipulating commands.

Whenver you find yourself in this position hit __&lt;CTRL&gt;+X &lt;CTRL&gt;+E__ to drop the current command into your $EDITOR.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/vim_mode_before.jpg" />

Sweet $EDITOR.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/vim_mode_after.jpg" />

We can edit the command and save quit to get it back on our terminal.

## Plugins for your favourite tool

oh-my-zsh has a comprehnsive list of plugins for tools you may use. I use the __rake__ plugin which allows you to tab into available rake commands from your Rakefile.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/rake_before.jpg" />

Double __&lt;TAB&gt;__ to enter a keyboard navigatable list.

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/rake_after.jpg" />

## Good enough?

I wasn't aware of how useful Zsh is an interactive shell until recently. The big reasons to change shell are:

* Tab complete and navigate all the things
* A vibrant plugin community providing a sensible baseline for our dotfiles
* 99% of what you know from Bash still works

Are you ready to __chsh__?
