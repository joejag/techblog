## Practice Cards

Practices, according to Shove [2012](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dynamics-Social-Practice-Everyday-Changes/dp/0857020439), are made up of three elements :

- **Meaning**: the motivational, emotional and aspirational. It’s why we should care.
- **Materials**: the resources, like money, time, gadgets, and infrastructures you need to do the practice
- **Competencies**: the skills and knowledge that are needed to do the practice

For example, showering:

- **Meaning**: cleanliness, freshness, convenience
- **Materials**: a shower, hot running water, soap
- **Competencies**: how to use the shower controls, how to control the boiler

Practice is the interconnection between these elements. When you perform a practice, you use your skills to manipulate materials to create meaning.

Practices are often socially copied by others who see performances of them. [Marc Burgauer](https://twitter.com/somesheep) had the idea of capturing and representing these three elements as cards. For example, we currently see the practice of Static Code Analysis as:

<style>

table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  width: 100%;
}

th, td {
  text-align: left;
  padding: 8px;
}

tr:nth-child(even){background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);}

th {
  background-color: rgb(102, 102, 102);
  color: white;
}

th {
    text-align: center;
}

.post-content table ul {
    padding-left: 0;
}
</style>

<table class='practice-card'>
    <tr><th colspan=2>Static Code Analysis</th></tr>
    <tr><td>
        <strong>Meaning</strong>
        <br/>
        <em>Why do we care? Who benefits?</em>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>Mandatory security vulnerability scanning.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bug detection before code hits production.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>
        <strong>Materials</strong>
        <br/>
        <em>What do you use to do it?</em>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>SonarCloud</li>
                <li>SonarLint (IntelliJ, VSCode)</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>
        <strong>Competancies</strong>
        <br/>
        <em>If you joined a new team, what would you look for to know they are already doing it well?</em>
        </td>
        <td><ul>
            <li>Sonar is configured just for major bugs and security vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Pull Requests are marked if a major issue is found</li>
            <li>Security hotspots and vulnerabilities have been fixed or marked as 'Safe' in the PR</li>
            <li>Sonar is configured to exclude irrelevant files for coverage. Test Coverage is stable or improving</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

By using Practice Cards, we gain a shared lens on how to see the behaviours occurring in our teams.

There are several advantages to using this model:

- We can capture ‘best practice' within our company for a practice and share it with others as a way of stabilising it
- We can capture the ‘friction’ teams are having adopting practices and decide if we can improve the climate for teams
- We can evolve practices by changing one of the elements (introduce a new tool, redefine the meaning of a practice, redefining what 'good’ looks like).

## How do we discover what practices we have?

It’s rare for a practice to exist on its own. It’s usually part of a more extensive capability with many connected practices. ‘Getting ready in the morning’ has many practices like Making Breakfast, Getting Dressed, Commuting; all of these have meaning, materials and competencies.

For a tech department, we usually have a few capabilities that we are interested in:

- Operational Excellence
- Delivery Excellence
- Quality Excellence

Each one has sub-capabilities, creating a chain of needs. For example, Operational Excellence needs:

- Path to Production (releasing software via pipelines, database migrations)
- Observability (monitoring, alerting, logging, post-incident response)
- Runtime Environment (block storage, containers, routing)

We can then dive into one of those capabilities to unpick the practices involved. [Chris McDermott](https://maturitymapping.com/2018/05/11/mapping-maturity-create-context-specific-maturity-models-with-wardley-maps-informed-by-cynefin-2/) wrote a few ways to do this within a team in 2018. I usually ask teams to make a list, for example, for Path to Production:

- Pipelines to deploy code
- Database migrations
- Version control on artifacts
- Static code analysis
- Version control on code

For each one you can then create a Practice Card using the prompts like “If you joined a new team, what would you look for to know they are already doing it well?”.

If you want to stay higher level, you can now immediately map the practice names and only delve into the elements of the practice you want to improve.

## Mapping practice maturity with Maturity Mapping

[Maturity Mapping](https://maturitymapping.com/) uses the concepts in [Wardley Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/home-deprecated/introduction/) mixed with Social Practice Theory. Wardley Mapping is about figuring out the competitive landscape for a capability:

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2021/wardley.png"/>

The Y-Axis represents how visible the part of the chain is to the User.

The X-Axis is how evolved the capability is.

This sets the landscape for making strategic decisions about what to build or buy or where we have a bias in our value chain.

Maturity Mapping uses this template but changes the X-Axis to indicate how ‘mature’ (as in developed) the practices are. We can then place each practice accordingly to its maturity in the context.

In Maturity Mapping, the X-Axis is separated into:

- **Novel**
  - Aware of the practice
  - Experimenting with the practice
- **Emerging**
  - Getting to grips with it
  - Getting some value from the practice
- **Good**
  - Doing some aspects of the practice repeatedly
  - Needs improvement
- **Best**
  - Doing all aspects of the practice consistently
  - An example of what good looks like

We can now ask questions grounded in the present like:

- Which practice do we want to improve?
- How can I improve the current way of working?
- What friction is there that is stopping us from improving this practice?

It’s worth revisiting the Maturity Map once a quarter to see what the new state of play is.

## How can we capture Maturity at scale?

You can run a Maturity Mapping session with Practice Cards once a quarter as a retrospective with teams. Then ask them to report back. They don’t have to use mapping software; we just need to know the X-Axis scale they think they are at. So you run the retro by asking:

- How well are we doing this practice?
- What friction is in our environment preventing us from getting better?
- Action: What practice shall we get better at next?

The maturity rating and friction points can be reported back, then the team decides which practice they can improve themselves.

I’ve ran a session where 100 developers used [Menti](https://mentimeter.com/) to quickly capture the current state of maturity. Each person was allowed to see the Practice Cards with a scale to say how they are doing:

<img width="100%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2021/menti-1.png"/>

This was followed up with questions about what friction points people saw with the practices. From this, we could see that one practice was more mature than the other.

## When do I map?

Mapping is part of the strategy cycle.

We map things after we’ve discovered our ‘purpose'. Once we’ve mapped out the landscape, we can consider what environmental factors are in place then decide on what action to take next.

[Simon Wardley](https://medium.com/hackernoon/rebooting-gds-96b1595096fa) sees mapping as part of an OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop of strategy.

Mapping is part of the ‘Landscape' while we Observe the environment before taking action. It’s there to help us make better decisions about what to do.
