title: "Three little questions"
---

I'm keen on asking two questions during every interview. They don't have a right textbook answer. The only way to answer them is by being honest. They are:

* "Tell me about a work place where you felt you were able to do your best work"
* "Tell me about a work place where you didn't feel like you could do your best work"

I always find the answers illuminating. Folk tend to open up and say their preferences. There's no trick here. I'm trying to see if that person would be happy to work where I am. It's clinched close candidates before as I knew one person was more likely to enjoy working here.

Recently, I've been trying to find a way to do the inverse. How can I find out if I would be happy at any potential new employer.

Most interviews take place outside of the real working environment. You can't see the constraints the team are working under. So we are looking for questions that talk about their culture. We want to check where the inertia is that we won't be able to change. We aren't looking for things that are easy to change like tool choices and libraries. We want to find the big things. 

If you need inspiration look for the constraints that pissed you off at previous jobs.

Here's my three questions. Yours should be different:

* Can I pair program?
* When did you last release?
* Can your teams deploy to production?

There's a why behind each. And I expect asking them will lead to follow up questions.

__Can I pair program?__ is about their reaction to collaboration. I've seen a tech lead go red in the face talking about productivity here. I knew I would not be happy there.

__When did you last release?__ is about checking that releases are a non-event. Some places haven't performed a release ever. Which is a big red flag if they've been going for a few months. Moving a culture to frequent releases is hard, but without management support it's hard.

__Can your teams deploy to production?__ is about trust. So many issues dissappear when someone can say "Let's try it in production with a limited set of traffic and see what happens". As soon as hand-offs enter the game it's a constant conversation about opinions and strength of arguments. Trying safe to fail experiments trumps opinion.

For all three, if management suppose isn't there then I'll spend my time getting frustrated, knowing I could be helping much more.

You should know what your three questions are. Your sanity could be at stake.

I asked on Twitter what other folks questions would be. Again looking for questions that have a cultural constraint behind them. Here's a sample:

* What is your diversity like, and what are you doing to improve it?
* What was the last architectural change and how is it going?
* When was the last time someone on the team was promoted?
* How do you make sure you set up teams for success?
* Are your stakeholders local, available, and involved?
* Is there a PMO and if so do you plan to get rid of it? ;-)
* Do I have to do a time sheet? 
* How do you know that your stuff works?
